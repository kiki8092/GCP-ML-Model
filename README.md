# Heart Disease classification dataset and Training/Inference Scripts

## Dataset Description
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 

The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.

## Feature Information
- sno - Obsevation Index
- age
- sex
- chest pain type (4 values)
- resting blood pressure
- serum cholestoral in mg/dl
- fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
- maximum heart rate achieved
- exercise induced angina
- oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
- thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
